I'm Cl√©mentine ‚ú®, a research scientist in machine learning @huggingface!

Previously I worked on fun stuff: 
- graph transformers (see my [Intro Blog](https://huggingface.co/blog/intro-graphml)); 
- the possible alliances between neural networks and historical linguistics (see my [thesis](https://hal.inria.fr/tel-03793299) and [publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UiK-jPcAAAAJ&hl=en&authuser=1)); 
- integrating software to predict Alzheimer for the Human Brain Project ([poster](https://hal.science/hal-02466386));
- programming for geological modelling.

Python is my friend üêç.
